Instruction Manual
1. Accessing the Tool:
Ensure you are using a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) for the best experience.
2. Uploading Images:
You can upload `.webp` image files in two ways:
Drag & Drop: Drag one or more `.webp` images from your computer into the dashed drop area.
Click to Upload: Click inside the dashed drop area to open the file explorer and select the images manually.
Once the images are successfully uploaded, a message will appear saying "Image(s) submitted successfully!" indicating that the files have been recognized.
Only `.webp` images are accepted. Uploading other formats will display an error message.
3. Converting to PDF:
After successfully uploading your images, click the green "Convert & Download PDF" button.
The tool will process the uploaded `.webp` files and convert them into a PDF file.
If multiple images were uploaded, each image will be placed on a separate page in the PDF to avoid overlap or clutter.
4. Downloading the Result:
Once the conversion is complete, the PDF will be automatically downloaded to your device with the name "webp_to_pdf.pdf".
The exported PDF includes a footer on each page stating "Generated by Xfinity Tools" along with the current date for easy tracking.
5. Tips & Recommendations:
Ensure your images are clear and high-resolution for better output quality.
Limit very large images or excessive file sizes if you experience slow processing or browser lag.
Use image compression tools beforehand if necessary to optimize the size of your `.webp` files.
6. Troubleshooting:
If the tool doesn't respond, make sure your browser has JavaScript enabled.
Check that your files are of `.webp` format. Other formats (like `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.) are not accepted.
If the PDF download doesn’t start, try refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache.
